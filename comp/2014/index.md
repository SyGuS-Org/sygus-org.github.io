The 1<sup>st</sup> Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (SyGuS-Comp)
took place as a satellite event of FLoC, CAV and SYNT 2014.


### Evaluation

Solvers are evaluated on the [StarExec] platform,
which provided 200 dual quad-core machines with 256GB memory each.
The solvers are run with a _TIMEOUT_ value as well.
The solvers were compared against 250 benchmarks
and the scores were based primarily on the number of benchmark solved and the solving time,
and secondarily on the succinctness of the synthesized solution.


### Participating Solvers
