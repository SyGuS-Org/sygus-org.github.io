We have setup a community for SyGuS on [StarExec],
a platform developed by the University of Iowa for running online competitions.

You are invited to register to the SyGuS community on StarExec,
where the SyGuS-Comp public solvers and benchmarks are available.
Each year, we make all the benchmarks and solvers public after the conclusion of SyGuS-Comp.
You can use StarExec to check validity of newly created benchmarks,
run the public solvers on your own set of benchmarks,
and/or easily and discreetly test your solver against the public or your own benchmarks.

On GitHub, we have released the source code for
- [three initial SyGuS solvers](https://github.com/rishabhs/sygus-comp14/tree/master/solvers):
    - an _enumerative_ solver by Abhishek Udupa,
    - a _stochastic_ solver by [Mukund Raghothaman], and
    - a_symbolic_ solver by Garvit Juniwal
- [a parser for SyGuS-IF](https://github.com/rishabhs/sygus-comp14/tree/master/parser/synthlib2parser).

**UPDATE:**
We are currently also making the source code for the SyGuS-correctness checker and
the pre/post-processing scripts used for SyGuS-Comp on StarExec available on
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/SyGuS-Org/tools).
The benchmarks are also being sorted and deduplicated, and would soon be available on
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/SyGuS-Org/benchmarks).
Stay tuned!
